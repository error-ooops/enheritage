        Education and training are at the heart of what we do. With that in
        mind, we have launched a new type of membership specifically designed
        for educational institutions and training providers. Enhance your
        students’ learning and give them access to the NH’s network of
        conservation professionals via our Regional Groups. They’ll also benefit
        from the opportunity to gain hands-on training at our working parties,
        and priority booking to selected NH courses for continuing professional
        development. <br /> <br /> Online membership gives each student a exclusive articles,
        discounts and deals, priority booking to selected NH courses, and the
        ability to book members’ only events around the country. They can also
        choose to receive our monthly members’ newsletter by email, and to join
        us at working parties to gain hands-on experience in repairing old
        buildings. This membership is specifically aimed at educational
        organisations and training providers. That includes anything from
        colleges and universities to employers with a number of apprentices /
        trainees. Your students will likely gain the most benefit from
        membership if your course or work is mainly or partly to do with the
        heritage sector or construction industries, but we welcome sign ups from
        any educational body.
