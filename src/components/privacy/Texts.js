                    We do: use your personal data to help us provide a  great experience for you. This includes tailoring <br /> the information we  share to ensure you find it relevant, useful and timely. <br />
                    <br />

                    We do: respect your privacy and work hard to ensure we meet strict regulatory requirements. <br />

                    <br />
                    We’ll always protect your personal data and, as part of this, we  regularly review our privacy notice so that you can see how we use your  data and what your options are. If there are any further changes to the  ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (or GDPR) or related laws, we may  need to amend this statement in the future. <br />

                    A few quick notes: <br />
                    <br />
                    This privacy policy explains what data we collect as well as how and why we use your personal data <br />
                    The policy applies to you if you’re a supporter of the Trust  (whether that’s as a member, donor, volunteer, tenant, customer or  employee) or use any of our services, visit our website, use our mobile  app, email, call or write to us. In certain circumstances we may also  provide an extra privacy notice, which will always refer to this page <br />
                    We’ll never sell your personal data. We will only share it with organisations we work with who meet our high privacy standards. <br />
                    <br />
                    Fundacja New Heritage (“New Heritage”, “us”, “we” or “our”) is committed  to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Information we  may collect. New Heritage has created this privacy policy (“Privacy  Policy”) to advise you about our information practices, such as the  types of information we collect and how we may use that information, and  to inform you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.  We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our  policies and practices regarding your Personal Information and how we  will treat it. By visiting any part of our Websites (as defined below)  or otherwise providing New Heritage with Personal Information by any means,  you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy  and your continued use of the Websites (following the posting of a  revised privacy policy) means that you accept and agree to the terms of  the revised privacy policy, so please check the policy periodically for  updates. <br />

                    I. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE <br />
                    <br />
                    A. Application of this privacy policy <br />
                    <br />
                    This Privacy Policy applies to www.nheritage.org and all other  websites, features, or online services that are owned or controlled by New Heritage and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the  “Websites”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or  otherwise. Note, however, this Privacy Policy does not apply to use of  unaffiliated websites that link to our Websites. Once you enter another  website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be  aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. <br />
                    <br />
                    B. Purpose of this privacy policy <br />
                    <br />
                    This Privacy Policy aims to give you information on how New Heritage collects and uses your Personal Information through your use of the  Websites, including any information you may provide through the Websites  when you sign up for an account, sign up to receive information or  communications from us, purchase a product or service, or request  further services or information from us. <br />
                    <br />
                    It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any  other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on  specific occasions when we are collecting or using Personal Information  about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your  information. This Privacy Policy supplements the other notices and is  not intended to override them. <br />
                    <br />
                    C. Children <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Websites are not designed for, or directed to, children under the  age of 16 and New Heritage does not intentionally collect information about anyone under the age of 16 on the Websites. If New Heritage discovers  that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from anyone  younger than the age of 16, we will attempt to delete the information as  soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal  Information from a child under 16, please contact us at  privacy@nheritage.org. <br />
                    <br />
                    D. Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes <br />

                    <br />
                    We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to,  change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such  change, update or modification on the Websites. Any such change, update  or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the  Websites. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will  notify you by email. However, unless you consent, New Heritage will not use  your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what  was stated in our posted Privacy Policy at the time your Personal  Information was collected. Please check this Privacy Policy regularly to  ensure you are aware of any changes in our practices. <br />
                    <br />
                    It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is  accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal  Information changes during your relationship with us. You are  responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit  to us, such as your contact information. If you contact us with changes,  we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our  then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Note, however,  that information may persist internally for our administrative purposes  and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. <br />
